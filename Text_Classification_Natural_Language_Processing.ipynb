ledux disappeared on her wedding day in the year of 1840 and when the dress was found the people of new orleans assumed that the bride had committed suicide by throwing herself into the river this is how the story begins and then we find out what really happened as the story of claire ledux is revealed\\r\\nwhen claire arrives in new orleans for the first time in her life she has a strong ambition to become mrs charles giraud  a very rich and renowned banker she gets her opening one night at the opera when she manages to bet the seat next to the banker trying to catch the unsuspecting bankers attention she fakes fainting in her seat the banker immediately rushes to her rescue and claires mission is accomplished desperate to the beautiful claire again charles sends his valet over to claires maid clementine after the opera the maid forwards the message asking claire to meet with charles in the park claire and the maid make a plan to let a man harass claire in the park so that charles can come to her rescue but even the simplest plans go wrong and on the way to the park claires carriage runs over a monkey by accident the monkey belongs to river boat captain robert latour he stops the carriage but since clementine believes this is the man they hired to make a fuzz with them she tells the driver to go on and ignore the man robert latour is aggravated by this behaviour and tips the carriage over\\r\\nafter this incident where charles was not only stood up by claire since the carriage never arrived but also deprived of a chance to come to her aid he swears to avenge robert latours insolent behaviour he also vows to properly take care of and guard claire every night from now on\\r\\nattending a mardi gras festivity claire recognizes robert latour in the crowd and points him out to charles who is quick to challenge robert to a duel robert gets to choose weapons and he chooses knives something charles isnt quite prepared for robert gets a distinct advantage over charles in the duel and claire steps in to interrupt what she fears will be the end of the bankers life she tells charles that she mistook robert for someone else thus ending the battle\\r\\nso settle the matter once and for all robert invites claire to dinner on his rover boat the following night he borrows 150 dollars to pay for the feast but while claire is getting ready for her meeting with robert charles arrives and throws her a proposal of marriage there on the spot claire accepts his proposl and sends a message via her maid to robert cancelling the dinner without telling him the real reason robert fears that claire is taken ill and in need of a doctor he rushes over to her house to offer his assistance but sees charles through the window and realizes the real reason for her rejection\\r\\nonly two days before their wedding charles throws a party in claires honor to the party comes many distinguished guests and among them are the newly arrived russian gentleman zolotov this man sees claire and recognizes her from st petersburg during the evening zolotov tells stories of claire to a friend of his bellows and charles brotherinlaw hears them talk charles hears of the stories and is upset challenging zolotov to a duel zolotov has no wish to enter a duel with the banker and swears he must have been mistaken since the girl he knew was known to fake fainting to get a mans attention at this point claire faints  for real this time and is carried out of the room\\r\\nthe next day charles comes to visit claire in her home in order to break off their engagement he doesnt get to meet claire but is instead confronted by a woman named lili  claires lookalike and illegitimate cousin from st petersburg a woman of highly questionable reputation seen from charles point of view charles agrees to meet with lili that same night at the oyster bed caf\\xc3\\xa9 located down by the docks charles brings zolotov and bellows to the restaurant and demands that lili leave town never to return  he doesnt wish to be associated with the kind of woman she is feeling threatened lili decides to leave but before she does she bumps into robert latour robert opens his heart to lili and tells her he is in love with claire and has been since he first met with her charles finds lili and robert talking and promises to settle roberts loan debt if he takes lili out of new orleans robert agrees to this\\r\\nrobert passes by claires house and peers through the window seeing lili inside he puts two and two together and realizes that lili and claire are the same person he doesnt confront her but tells what he has found out to charles they conspire to abduct liliclaire and hide her away on roberts boat until the wedding once robert arrives back to his boat with claire he sets her free and she decides to stay the night the morning after claire tells robert that they will never see each other again\\r\\nthe wedding is held as planned a day later but when
